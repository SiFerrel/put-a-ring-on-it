*Modelling photon orbits and gravitational lensing in a general relativistic framework*

## Getting started
### Pre-requisites

Keeping track of the names and versions of the python modules used.
```
numpy
pandas
...
```

### Installing

### Use

`initialize_photons.py` takes in an image / object and converts it into a numpy array for processing

`initialize_lens.py` sets up the point mass(es) that will act as gravitational lens

`gen_relativity.py` contains modules we can call, with set values for G, c and conversion between different coordinate systems
